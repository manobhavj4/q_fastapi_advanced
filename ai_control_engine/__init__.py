AI Control Engine for Quantum Sensing System
--------------------------------------------
This package manages end-to-end AI-driven control of quantum sensors, 
including digital twin modeling, real-time optimization, and model orchestration.

Performance Optimizations:
- Lazy imports to reduce startup time
- Cached module loading with weak references
- Import-time optimization with deferred loading
- Memory-efficient module management
